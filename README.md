# FlashCards

### Solo Project

## Abstract

Have you ever found yourself needing just a couple moments more to practice or study? With this simple console flashcards game, you can get into some fun topics and exercise your brain!

In this project, we were asked to write a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line ONLY. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.
