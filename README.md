# FlashCards

### Solo Project


## Abstract

Have you ever found yourself needing just a couple moments more to practice or study? With this simple console flashcards game, you can quickly review Iterator methods and related topics before your next Mod 2 quiz!

In this Mod 2 solo project, we were asked to write a program to simulate a deck of flash cards through the command line ONLY. A user should be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score as well as how long they took at the end of the round.

- Run `node index.js` to start the game that you will play on your terminal
- The test results will output to the terminal.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript, ES6 classes, TDD, Mocha, Chai 

## Project Goals / Wins / And Future Features

- Feeling more comfortable with ES6, testing suites, class to class interaction, and importing and exporting files. 
- I was able to get the extension of the timer for the game completed. That was intereesting to research as most timers I saw connect to the DOM, and this one does not. 
- With more time, I would like to convert the seconds to minutes on my timer with an additional method inside the Round class and use interpolation to add "minutes" and "seconds" as labels in the display message.
